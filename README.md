# CodingAssignment
Our custom-build server logs different events to a file named logfile.txt. Every event has 2 entries in the file
- one entry when the event was started and another when the event was finished. The entries in the file
have no specific order

#To run the app
Clone the git repo
git clone https://github.com/sokumbhar/CodingAssignment.git

Open the project in an IDE of your choice.

#Run the main application - com.github.sokumbhar.CodingAssignment.MyApplication

Create/Update the Run Configuration for the class to provide the program argument.

#A sample log file is available in resources/Events.txt
Summary of task
Our custom-build server logs different events to a file named logfile.txt. Every event has 2 entries in the file - one entry when the event was started and another when the event was finished. The entries in the file have no specific order (a finish event could occur before a start event for a given id).

Every line in the file is a JSON object containing the following event data:

id - the unique event identifier
state - whether the event was started or finished (can have values STARTED or FINISHED)
timestamp - the timestamp of the event in milliseconds
Application Server logs also have the following additional attributes:

type - type of log
host - hostname
Example contents can be found in Events.txt

The program should:

Take the path to Events.txt as an input argument
Parse the contents of Events.txt
Flag any long events that take longer than 4ms
Write the found event details to file-based HSQLDB (http://hsqldb.org/) in the working folder
The application should create a new table if necessary and store the following values:
Event id
Event duration
Type and Host if applicable
Alert (true if the event took longer than 4ms, otherwise false)
